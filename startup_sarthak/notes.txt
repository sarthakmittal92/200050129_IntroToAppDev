The main() method uses arrow (=>) notation. Use arrow notation for one-line functions or methods.
The app extends StatelessWidget, which makes the app itself a widget. In Flutter, almost everything is a widget, including alignment, padding, and layout.
The Scaffold widget, from the Material library, provides a default app bar, and a body property that holds the widget tree for the home screen. The widget subtree can be quite complex.
A widget's main job is to provide a build() method that describes how to display the widget in terms of other, lower level widgets.
The body for this example consists of a Center widget containing a Text child widget. The Center widget aligns its widget subtree to the center of the screen.
